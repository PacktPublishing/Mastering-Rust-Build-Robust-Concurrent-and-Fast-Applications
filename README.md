# Mastering Rust – Build Robust, Concurrent, and Fast Applications [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Rust – Build Robust, Concurrent, and Fast Applications [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/mastering-rust-build-robust-concurrent-and-fast-applications-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Developers love Rust as a programming language for various reasons. It's safe and more secure than its contemporaries; it's also good at maintaining performance. Rust uses a modern inbuilt dependency and build management system to provide concurrency.

This course will show you how to use these benefits of Rust to enhance your programming experience. You will understand how Rust improves performance and handles errors to make your code reliable. Also, you'll test your programs and take your code to the next level with concurrency. The course demonstrates how you can build scalable and reliable programs with Rust. 

By the end of the course, you will be able to build and implement high-performance software applications to fulfill your organization's needs and requirements.
